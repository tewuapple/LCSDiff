Longest common subsequence
-------
The longest common subsequence (LCS) problem is to find the longest subsequence common to all sequences in a set of sequences (often just two). Note that subsequence is different from a substring, see substring vs. subsequence. It is a classic computer science problem, the basis of file comparison programs such as diff, and has applications in bioinformatics.

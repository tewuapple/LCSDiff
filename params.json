Note that subsequence is different from a substring, see substring vs. subsequence. It is a classic computer science problem, the basis of file comparison programs such as diff, and has applications in bioinformatics.\r\n\r\nIt's C sharp version base on it.\r\nLicenses\r\n--------\r\n- LCSDiff is licensed under the terms of the Apache 2.0 License.
